    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
    the other scientific journals her work had
    appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of On
    The Road. It had been Molly's favorite book
    since college, and the longer she spent in these
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be
    free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
    sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
    proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
    people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
    the secrets of the llama , to be an
    outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
    she had something better to do.</p>
